To report security-related issues, please join the TCN Hub at https://discord.gg/FG2wpbywSx and DM any observer (user with the "Observers" role at the top of the member sidebar). Alternatively, you may DM "Teyvat Collective" to open a modmail thread and ask for an observer to contact you. Do **not** report the issue through modmail; you may use it to request a currently active observer to reach out to you.
